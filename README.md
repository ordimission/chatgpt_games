# chatgpt_games

a game writtten by chat gpt 4 ( following https://github.com/cadeli/thanks_to_gpt ) without any change :

prompts : write a code in javascript for a simple game using p5.js in the style of space invaders

add more advanced enemy behavior
enemy can fire bullets
enemy must change direction when the edge of the screen is reached left or right
write a "wait for space key pressed " code when the game is over
can you remind me the whole code obtained finally ?
can you make exactly the same game with Python 3 and the pygame library ?
